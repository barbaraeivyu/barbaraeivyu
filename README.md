I'm a passionate **security researcher** and **ethical hacker** specializing in vulnerability exploits and cybersecurity education. My Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) spotlight risks in enterprise software and AI systems—strictly for research purposes only! Let's make the digital world safer together. 🚀

## 🔍 My Interests
- **Exploit Development**: Remote Code Execution (RCE), Privilege Escalation, and beyond! 💥
- **Cloud & Hybrid Security**: Securing AWS, Azure, and on-prem hybrids. ☁️
- **AI/ML Vulnerabilities**: Uncovering flaws in machine learning models and inference servers. 🤖
- **Python Automation**: Scripting tools for pentesting and vuln hunting. 🐍

## 🛠️ Featured Projects
